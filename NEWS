chouca v0.2.99 (Release date: unknown)
==============================================

Major improvements: 

  - Neighborhoods can now be specified using logical matrices, allowing for arbitrary
      types of neighborhood and not only the nearest cells

  - A new function, camodel_mat, can be used to specify models using matrices and arrays
      of real numbers, instead of symbolic expressions. This is much faster for models 
      with many states and transitions, but simple mathematical forms of transition
      probabilities
  
Minor improvements: 

  - Make sure the 'times' vector is well-formatted in run_camodel(), and return 
      an informative error if this is not the case. This helps dealing with cases where 
      the 'times' argument and 'initmat' arguments of run_camodel() are inverted.
